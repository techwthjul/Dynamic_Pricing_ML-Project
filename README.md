🌐 Airfare Forecasting ✈️📊 (Dynamic Pricing)
📘 Overview
This project focuses on building a machine learning model to predict optimal flight prices based on various factors such as booking date, travel date, airline, and other flight attributes. The goal is to simulate a dynamic pricing model that adjusts fares based on demand, seasonality, and booking behavior, helping airlines maximize revenue while providing customers with the best possible price.

🎯 Project Goals
The main objectives of this project are to:

## Analyze key factors that impact flight prices.
Build a predictive model for dynamic pricing.
Visualize relationships between features and prices to gain insights into airline pricing patterns.
📊 Dataset
The dataset contains detailed information on flight bookings, with the following key features:

Date_of_journey: The flight date.
Airline: The airline operating the flight.
Class: Travel class (e.g., Economy, Business).
Departure and Arrival times.
Duration_in_hours: Total flight duration.
Total_stops: Number of stops during the flight.
Days_left: Number of days left until departure.
Fare: Target variable representing the flight price.
Sample Dataset
Date_of_journey	Airline	Class	Duration_in_hours	Days_left	Fare
2023-01-16	Indigo	Economy	2.0833	10	5335
2023-01-20	SpiceJet	Business	3.4167	5	10200
🛠️ Project Workflow
1. Data Preprocessing
Goal: Clean and transform the data for modeling.

Convert Categorical Data: Encode categorical variables like Airline, Class, and Source to make them compatible with the machine learning model.
Create Time-based Features: Extract new features like Days_left (days until departure) and Journey_day (day of the week) to help capture booking and pricing patterns.
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Goal: Understand the relationships between different features and the target variable (Fare).

Visualization: Analyze how Fare changes with features like Days_left, Airline, Class, and Departure time.
Example: Price vs. Days Left
3. Feature Engineering
Goal: Add new features to enhance the model’s predictive power.

New Features: Create features like is_weekend (indicator for weekend travel) and is_peak_season (indicator for peak travel months). These capture pricing patterns influenced by day of the week and seasonality.
4. Model Selection and Training
Goal: Train a model to predict flight prices.

Random Forest Regressor: Chosen for its ability to handle non-linear relationships and mixed data types.
Train-Test Split: Split the data into training and testing sets to evaluate the model’s performance.
5. Model Evaluation
Goal: Measure the model’s accuracy and understand which features impact the price the most.

Evaluation Metrics: Calculate metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) to gauge the model’s predictive accuracy.
Feature Importance: Analyze the most impactful features that influence flight prices.
6. Results
Goal: Visualize the model's predictions and check alignment with actual prices.

Example: Predicted vs. Actual Prices
